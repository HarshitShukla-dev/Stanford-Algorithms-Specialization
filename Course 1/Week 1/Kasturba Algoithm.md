# Programming Assignment - Integer Multiplication

In this programming assignment, you will implement one or more integer multiplication algorithms described in the lecture.

To get the most out of this assignment, your program should restrict itself to multiplying only pairs of single-digit numbers. While you can implement the grade-school algorithm, to maximize learning, consider implementing recursive integer multiplication and/or Karatsuba's algorithm.

## Task

Find the product of the following two 64-digit numbers:

**Number 1:** 3141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592

**Number 2:** 2718281828459045235360287471352662497757247093699959574966967627

**TIP:** Before submitting, test your program's correctness on some small test cases. Share your best test cases on the discussion forums to help fellow students!

**Food for thought:** The number of digits in each input number is a power of 2. Does this make your life easier? Does it depend on which algorithm you're implementing?

**Numeric Answer:** (Type the answer here without any spaces, commas, or punctuation marks.)

Remember, you do not need to submit your code. Feel free to use any programming language you prefer. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
